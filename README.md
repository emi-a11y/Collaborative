## Project Purpose

This project demonstrates how our team uses Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub for version control and collaboration. The website explains Git setup, repository initialization, branching, commits, pushing, pull requests, reviews, merging, and synchronization.

## Group Members and Contributions

| Member | GitHub Username | Assigned File | Feature Branch | Contribution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Member 1] | [username] | index.html | feature-homepage | Homepage and group information |
| [Member 2] | [username] | setup.html | feature-setup-guide | Git installation and setup guide |
| [Member 3] | [username] | workflow.html | feature-team-workflow | Team collaboration workflow |
| [Member 4] | [username] | css/style.css | feature-styles | Layout and visual design |

## Required Team Workflow

```bash
git switch main
git pull origin main
git switch -c feature-name
git status
git diff
git add .
git commit -m "Describe the completed change"
git push -u origin feature-name
```

After pushing, the member creates a pull request on GitHub. Another member reviews the changes before merging. After the merge, every member runs:

```bash
git switch main
git pull origin main
```
